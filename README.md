# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
Created a website that loaded in UFO sightings data from a .JS file and was filtered using JavaScript. The displays where created by HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. This would help users filter through different UFO sightings based off of the Date, City, Stat, Country, and Shape of the UFO.

## Results:
The results from creating the website is now the end user can search the data with five different input filters. It first starts with a user accessing the webpage and then inputting any information about the UFO report.

As the user is inputting information into the fields the data will filter as  the user is typing.

Summary:
In summary, one drawback of this website is that the data set seems really small and doesn't give the user much info on where the data is coming from. I would recommend having a page that talks about where the data comes from and how often the data is updated. Another suggestion I would have is to have a quick summary on how to use the search box.
